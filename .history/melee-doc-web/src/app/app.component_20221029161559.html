  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcjclJ6iPYCIv2ocbS-OR8Q<br>
  Yeta aka The Vod God has uploaded many high level doc sets in the modern era.
  A very good reference tool.<br> 
</p>


<h2>Jabs</h2>

<h3>Jab 1</h3>
<p>
  Frame 2<br>
  One of Docs most useful neutral mixup tools, 
  it can set up for things like downsmash and grab. <br>
  Great for interrupting opponents movement and beating longer startup moves.<br>
  Ends frame 15 making it a great option to call out floaty landings as well. <br>
</p>
<h3>Jab 2</h3>
<p>
  Frame 2<br>
  Not often utilized and for good reason, its basically just jab 1 but you have to do jab 1 to set 
  it up, which means that it can be used as an additional mixup out of Jab 1, but not much else.
</p>
<h3>Jab 3</h3>
<p>
  Frame 4<br>
  The same as jab 2 except has some knockback to it so it can be a get off me tool at times and 
  it can work on shield some what well, also has one of the lowest reaches of any of his moves 
  at ledge.
</p>

<h3>Dash Attack</h3>
<p>
  Frame 6<br>
  Situational combo tool<br>
  Decent burst option<br>
  Sends opponents straight up<br>
  Can cause doc to “low profile” certain moves.<br>
  Leads to a techchase, especially on fast fallers.
</p>

<h2>Tilts</h2>

<h3>Down Tilt</h3>
<p>
  Frame 5<br>
  Used as a mixup to confuse your opponent in scraps to lead to a tech chase or edgeguard.<br>
  Much more practically used to set up edgeguards at around mid-high%, however can be amsah teched.
</p>
<h3>Forward Tilt</h3>
<p>Frame 4<br>
  Docs best poke tool, if its spaced well it can't be punished on whiff 
  by some characters and can't be punished on shield.<br>
  It's also useful for edgeguarding on stage as well.
  The low angle can cover many options for grabbing ledge.<br> 
  It can set up for a techchase situation too.
  </p>
<h3>Up Tilt</h3>
<p>
  Frame 4<br>
  A great combo tool and docs best anti air<br>
  The first frame hitbox sends opponent away and can set up for edgeguards at high %s.<br>
  Its hitbox lingers and it doesn't have much lag either.<br>
  Best used with dthrow, uthrow, landing uair, and dash attack.
</p>

<h2>Smash Attacks</h2>

<h3>Down Smash</h3>
<p>
  Frame 5<br>
  Easily docs best smash attack, amazing kill move and counter move.<br>
  Can set up for techchases can be used in techchases.<br>
  Can cover rolls with back hit.<br>
  Can be hard to punish on shield if spaced well.<br>
  It really does just about everything a move can do. When in doubt, downsmash.
</p>
<h3>Forward Smash</h3>
<p>
  Frame 12
  Doc's best kill move, but poor range 
  Extremely good reward off of :
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Techchases</li>
    <li>Hard Reads</li>
    <li>Uair/DI mix up Finisher</li>
    <li>Punishing Undershoots</li>
    <li>Punishing Laggy Up-B Recoveries i.e. Shiek and Falcon</li>
  </ul>
<h3>Up Smash</h3>
<p>
  Frame 9 (Frame 10 OoS)
  The worst of the smash attacks but not bad by any means. It's mainly more useful against 
  characters like yoshi who you can't hit anything else with out of dthrow, so floaties.<br>
  It also has some use when opponents are coming down due to hurtbox shift and head invincibilty
  like Falco laser (needs testing).<br>
  If the opponent is grounded it can setup for kills since it spikes them (grounded only)<br>
  Great for chain grab finishers
</p>

<h2>Aerial Attacks</h2>
<h3>Bair</h3>
<p>
  Frame 6 (Frame 10 oos)<br>
  Doc's second best edgeguarding and poking tool extremely good for walling out
  and dealing with CC.<br>
  Can be used as an approach option and a retreat option<br>
  Due to its low amount of end lag, doc can sh bair
  and be actionable before they hit the ground.<br>
  Can waveland out of instant sh bair.
  </p>
<h3>Dair</h3>
<p>
  Frame 10 (Frame 14 oos)<br>
  Good for reading sh and fh.<br>
  Can combo into a landing aerial or a dj aerial.<br>
  can be good to come down with too, just don't overuse, especially not aggressively.<br>
  Auto cancels out of a full hop.<br>
  Combos into jab on autocancel.
</p>
<h3>Nair</h3>
<p>
  Frame 3 (Frame 7 oos)<br>
  Situational kill move good combo tool.<br>
  Good burst option decent oos option.<br>
  Can be used to edgeguard.<br>
  Good approach option.<br>
  Great when opponent is on ledge.
</p>
<h3>Uair</h3>
<p>Frame 4 (Frame 8 oos)<br>
  Very important to learn SHFF auto cancel for combo and neutral.<br>
  Docs best move for crossing up.<br>
  Very good for approaching fading back and hitting ppl on plats.<br>
  Arguably docs best combo tool.<br>
  Very good burst option.<br>
  All of this is due to being near lagless because it autocancels at basically any point.<br>
 </p>

<h2>Special Moves</h2>
<h3>Down Special (Dr. Tornado aka Doctor Copter)</h3>
<p>
  Frame 8<br>
  An incredible recovery move, terrible at almost everything else.<br>
  Best used at the beginning of your recovery when you're too far to be punished.<br>
  First hit does no hitstun, last hit is a decent launcher that can have some niche use.<br>
  Can be used to mixup your landing timing with a light mash.
  Ex: Marth and Falco uptilts.<br>
  Can be used to break up Popo and Nana.<br>
  It is a swag option and therefore does psychological damage to your opponent.<br>
  How to practice Mash: 
  Go to yoshi's island and stand under top plat.
  Aim to gain height where you can land on top plat.<br>
  Perfect Tornado Press (PTP) Info:

</p>
<h3>Neutral Special (Megavitamins aka Pills)</h3>
<p>
  Frame 14<br>
  Super important for controlling space and coaxing your opponent into approaching.<br>
  More details later.
</p>
<h3>Up Special (Super Jump Punch)</h3>
<p>
  Frame 3 (Frame 4 OoS)<br>
  Invincible on the first active frame, a decent “get off me” tool.<br>
  Can be cancelled allowing for a wide range of options.<br>
  More details later.
</p>
<h3>Side Special (Super Sheet)</h3>
<p>
  Frame 12<br>
  Doc's most important edgeguarding tool.<br>
  VERY large hitblox.<br>
  Stalls doc in air only on first use.
  Must land to regain cape stall.<br>
  Turns the opponent around even in shield, making it an interesting mixup.<br>
  Most relevant in neutral in the Marth MU.<br>
