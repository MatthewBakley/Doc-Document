<br>This guide will talk more in terms of application.</p>


<h2>Jabs</h2>

<h3>Jab 1</h3>
<p>
  Frame 2<br>
  One of Docs most useful neutral mixup tools, 
  it can set up for things like downsmash and grab. <br>
  Great for interrupting opponents movement and beating longer startup moves.<br>
  Ends frame 15 making it a great option to call out floaty landings as well. <br>
</p>
<h3>Jab 2</h3>
<p>
  Frame 2<br>
  Not often utilized and for good reason, its basically just jab 1 but you have to do jab 1 to set 
  it up, which means that it can be used as an additional mixup out of Jab 1, but not much else.
</p>
<h3>Jab 3</h3>
<p>
  Frame 4<br>
  The same as jab 2 except has some knockback to it so it can be a get off me tool at times and 
  it can work on shield some what well, also has one of the lowest reaches of any of his moves 
  at ledge.
</p>


<h2>Tilts</h2>

<h3>Down Tilt</h3>
<p></p>
<h3>Forward Tilt</h3>
<p>Frame 4<br>
  Docs best poke tool, if its spaced well it can't be punished on whiff 
  by some characters and can't be punished on shield.<br>
  It's also useful for edgeguarding on stage as well.
  The low angle can cover many options for grabbing ledge.<br> 
  It can set up for a techchase situation too.

<h3>Up Tilt</h3>

<h3>Down Smash</h3>
<h3>Forward Smash</h3>
